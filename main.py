Battling is the most important part of the game and represents a 
substantial amount of coins. Prior to entering a battle, it is 
advisable to ensure that your health is at its maximum level to 
minimize the risk of defeat. The village health is determined through
a combination of your character's stats and a 
random number generation (RNG) factor.

Once the battle begins, you will be presented with a menu 
displaying your character's stats. It is imperative to 
review these stats, as if you have neglected to upgrade your 
health, it will become apparent at this stage. Next, you will be 
asked to choose a weapon from the available options, each 
possessing its own unique abilities. No weapon is better than the other,
but it depends on which weapon best suits you.

After selecting your weapon, you will be given a choice 
between three different scenarios, each with its distinct 
advantages and disadvantages in terms of coins earned,
damage dealt, and the likelihood of inflicting damage. 
The outcome of each scenario will be determined by both your 
current stats and an RNG factor.

The battle can conclude in either victory, or defeat. If victorious, 
you will keep all the coins earned during the battle. If defeated, 
you will lose 20% of your current coins. If defeated while having a 
lifesaver equipped, you will be able to continue with the battle with
full health once again. After this you can still die, but it is very 
unlikely.

In conclusion, battling is a vital aspect of the game that offers a 
substantial source of coins. It is advisable to invest time into 
upgrading your character's stats before entering a battle. 
To initiate a battle, use the command "/battle".

Upgrading your stats is an essential aspect of playing the game, 
as it makes battling easier and enables you to reach the maximum stat 
levels more quickly. To upgrade a stat, simply enter the command 
"/upgrade" and specify which stat you wish to upgrade. 
The "/upgrades" command will display a menu with detailed information
about the cost of each upgrade and which stats are available for upgrading.
It should be noted that the cost of upgrades increases with each 
upgrade, and the maximum level for each stat is 10. At level 10, 
the stats are as follows: Attack: 50, Defense: 50, and Health: 250. 
Additionally, upgrading your health will also set it to its maximum 
value, which can be used as a strategic advantage to conserve coins 
rather than spending them on meat. The primary benefit of upgrading 
your stats is to more efficiently destroy villages and advance in the game.

Upon reaching the maximum levels for all of your stats, you will 
have officially won the game. Further information on winning can 
be found on Page 5 of the guidebook (Winning).{Style.RESET_ALL}

The in-game shop offers a range of items that can aid the player
in their progress through the game. The shop consists of three 
items: meat, a lifesaver, and a coin doubler. The cost of each 
item can be viewed by using the "/shop" command. To purchase an 
item, the player must use the "/buy [item]" command.

Meat is an essential item in the game, as it can restore health. 
It is almost impossible to complete the game without purchasing 
meat at least once. Meat restores 25 health points, but it will 
not exceed the player's maximum health. For example, if a 
player's maximum health is 115 and their current health is 110,
the meat will only restore 5 health points.

The lifesaver, costing 250 coins, is another useful item in the 
game. This item allows the player to continue battling even if 
their health reaches zero. If the lifesaver item is utilized,
the player's health will be restored to its maximum value and 
the lifesaver item will be consumed. The player must purchase 
the lifesaver item again in order to use it in subsequent battles. 
The effect of the lifesaver will remain in effect until the player 
logs out of the game or the lifesaver is consumed during a battle.
The player can check if they have a lifesaver active by using the "/stats" command.

Finally, the coin doubler costs 400 coins and doubles all coins
the player recieves for the next minute. It is a wise investment 
for players who can make the most of the one-minute time frame. 
The coin doubler will send a message when it's effect expires.{Style.RESET_ALL}

Winning the game is a major accomplishment and requires a combination
of strategy and determination. In order to win the game, you must 
first focus on leveling up your character's stats. The goal is to 
get all of your stats to level 10, which can be achieved by battling 
enemies and earning coins to upgrade your character's abilities.
Once you have accomplished this task, you will be rewarded with a 
special message and access to admin commands. This new level of 
access allows you to explore and experience the game on a whole new 
level, so make sure to work hard and earn those coins! I wonder what
you can do with admin commands... üëÄ. You will have to find out for
yourself. Good luck!{Style.RESET_ALL}
